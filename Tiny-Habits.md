## Question2 ##
How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
## Ans:-
The B = MAP formula, created by BJ Fogg, makes building habits simple. It stands for:

B = Behavior: The habit you want to build.
M = Motivation: Your desire to do it.
A = Ability: How easy it is to do.
P = Prompt: A reminder to take action.
How it works:
A habit happens when motivation, ability, and a prompt come together.

Motivation: Pick habits you care about.
Ability: Start small and make it easy.
Prompt: Use reminders or link it to something you already do.

## Question3
Question 3
Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit).
## Ans:-
Celebrating after completing a habit is important because it makes you feel good, and your brain loves that feeling.
When you celebrate, your brain connects the habit with positive emotions, making it more likely that you'll want to do it again.

## Question4 ##
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
## Ans:-
The key idea here is that most people believe they lack motivation when what they truly lack is a clear plan. They think they need more willpower to stick to habits like writing, meditating,
or working out, but the real problem is not having a structured approach. 
By creating a specific plan, you can increase your chances of success by 2-3 times. It's not about waiting for motivation to hit; 
it's about having a clear roadmap to follow.

## Question 5 ##
What is the book's perspective about Identity?
## Ans:-
Atomic Habits says that real change happens when you focus on who you want to be, not just what you want to achieve. 
Instead of saying "I want to lose weight," think "I’m a healthy person, so I work out regularly.
" When your habits match your identity, they become easier to stick with and last longer.

## Question 6 ##
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
## Ans:-
In *Atomic Habits*, James Clear suggests making habits easier by reducing obstacles. His third law, "Make it Easy," encourages setting up your environment to help you succeed.
For example, if you want to practice piano, keep it close by so it's easy to start. The fewer steps between you and the habit, the more likely you are to stick with it. 
By removing barriers, you increase your chances of building lasting habits that lead to big results over time.

## Question 7 ##
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

## Ans:-
In *Atomic Habits*, James Clear suggests making bad habits harder by doing the opposite of the good habit rules. 
To stop a bad habit, you should make it less noticeable, less appealing, harder to do, and less rewarding. 
For example, if you want to cut down on screen time, you can keep your phone out of sight or in another room, turn off notifications, or make using your phone less enjoyable. 
The goal is to make it harder to do the bad habit, so you’re less likely to continue it.

## Question 8 ##
Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

## Ans:-
If I want to drink more water. Here’s how I can make it easier:

  1.**Make it obvious**: Keep a water bottle on my desk or next to me all day so I see it and remember to drink.
  2.**Make it attractive**: Add some lemon or cucumber to my water to make it more enjoyable.
  3.**Make it easy**: Fill up my water bottle in the morning so I don’t have to think about it later.
  4.**Make it satisfying**: Track my water intake and celebrate reaching my goal with a small treat or break.

This will help me drink more water throughout the day!

## Question 9 ##
Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
## Ans:-
If I want to reduce my time on social media, here’s how I can make it harder:

1. **Make it invisible**: Turn off notifications or hide social media apps from my phone’s main screen.
2. **Make it unattractive**: Add a password or lock to make it harder to open the apps.
3. **Make it hard**: Set time limits on the apps so I can’t use them too much.
4. **Make it unsatisfying**: Turn off auto-login, so I have to type my password every time.

This will make it less tempting to spend time on social media!

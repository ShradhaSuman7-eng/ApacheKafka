The Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH), ensures a safe and respectful workplace for everyone, regardless of gender. It applies to all workplaces, public or private, and outlines steps to prevent and address sexual harassment.

## What is Sexual Harassment? ##
Sexual harassment includes any unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature that violates someone's dignity. It can happen to anyone, regardless of gender, and can take various forms:
Quid Pro Quo: When someone in power demands sexual favors for job benefits like promotions, salary hikes, or continued employment.
Hostile Work Environment: Repeated unwelcome actions that create a toxic workplace, including:
Verbal Harassment: Inappropriate jokes, offensive comments, or sexual innuendos.
Non-verbal Harassment: Staring, sharing explicit images, gestures, or suggestive body language.
Physical Harassment: Unwanted touching, blocking paths, or physical assault.

## How to Prevent Sexual Harassment ##

The POSH Act requires organizations to take the following steps to protect all employees:
Create a Clear Policy: Define what constitutes sexual harassment, the consequences for offenders, and the process for handling complaints.
Set Up an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC): A committee, preferably led by a woman, to handle and resolve complaints confidentially and impartially.
Conduct Training and Awareness Programs: Regularly educate all employees on recognizing, preventing, and reporting harassment, while emphasizing mutual respect and workplace safety.
Encourage Safe Reporting: Ensure that anyone can report harassment without fear of retaliation. Maintain confidentiality and take prompt, appropriate action.
Monitor and Review Regularly: Regularly update policies, review practices, and conduct audits to ensure a harassment-free environment.
Shared Responsibility


Preventing sexual harassment is a shared responsibility. Employers, employees, and leadership must work together to ensure a safe, inclusive, and respectful workplace for all, regardless of gender.
By implementing these measures, organizations can foster a positive and harassment-free work culture for everyone.
